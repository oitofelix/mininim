@chapter Constructions
@cindex constructions

@cindex position
@cindex room
@cindex floor
@cindex place
@cindex con
@cindex screen
@cindex tile
Each @dfn{level} is comprised of @dfn{rooms}@footnote{The terminology
used for @dfn{rooms} in the original game is @dfn{screens}.}.  Each room
is comprised of three @dfn{floors}.  Each floor is comprised of 10
@dfn{places}.  Each place holds a @dfn{construction} (or @dfn{con} for
short).@footnote{The terminology used for @dfn{constructions} in the
original game is @dfn{tiles}.}  The following figure illustrates this
arrangement.

@center @image{mininim-figures/level-layout}

@cindex coordinates, level
@cindex level coordinates
Therefore, any given construction is uniquely identified within a level
by the coordinates of its place@footnote{The term @emph{place} is used
throughout the text to describe both the last coordinate of the triplet
and the world space the triplet refers to.  Also, often the term
@emph{place} is omitted and the text refers just to the construction
itself, implying a reference to its place, as in ``the left
construction'', meaning ``the construction one place to the left''.
Hopefully, these shouldn't be a source of ambiguity.}, which are defined
as the triplet @emph{room}, @emph{floor} and @emph{place}:
@math{(r,f,p)}.

@cindex construction foreground
@cindex foreground, construction
@cindex construction background
@cindex background, construction
@cindex construction extension
@cindex extension, construction
Constructions are comprised of three elements: @emph{foreground},
@emph{background} and @emph{extension}.  A @dfn{construction foreground}
is the physical part the kid interacts with.  Physical properties
determined by it are collision, hang and fall conditions, to name a few.
On the other hand, a @dfn{construction background} is the part that yet
visible, doesn't affect the kid in any way --- its sole purpose is
ornamental; torches and windows are examples of this.  A
@dfn{construction extension} is a modifier which tells how the con looks
or behaves.  For example, items and door opening states are both
expressed by them.  Any given construction can have only one extension.
The valid extensions are:

@table @dfn
@cindex con ext item
@cindex item, con ext
@item Item
This is a code indicating which item should be put on the construction.
Used by @code{FLOOR}.
@cindex con ext can't fall
@cindex can't fall, con ext
@item Can't fall
This is a boolean indicating whether the construction should ignore
fall conditions.  Used by @code{LOOSE_FLOOR}.
@cindex con ext event
@cindex event, con ext
@item Event
This is an integer indicating which door event the construction
triggers.  Used by @code{OPENER_FLOOR} and @code{CLOSER_FLOOR}.
@cindex con ext step
@cindex step, con ext
@item Step
This is an integer indicating in which state, of a progressive set of
configurations, a construction is in.  Used by @code{SPIKES_FLOOR},
@code{DOOR}, @code{LEVEL_DOOR} and @code{CHOPPER}.
@cindex con ext design
@cindex design, con ext
@item Design
This is a code indicating which alternative graphical design should be
used to render the construction.  Used by @code{CARPET} and
@code{TCARPET}.
@end table

Integer extensions (@emph{event} and @emph{step}) may be negative
indicating that their respective constructions are broken.  Except for
this, the negative integer extension @var{i} is equivalent to the
non-negative @math{-i - 1} one.  While the @emph{event} extension may be
negative for any construction that uses it (@code{OPENER_FLOOR} and
@code{CLOSER_FLOOR}), the @emph{step} extension may only be so for
@code{LEVEL_DOOR}.

@node Non-directed relative positioning
@section Non-directed relative positioning
@cindex non-directed relative positioning
@cindex relative positioning, non-directed
@cindex positioning, non-directed relative

In order to easily talk about the relations between constructions it's
necessary to define the @dfn{non-directed relative positioning} of a
given place to its adjacent ones.  Consider the place @emph{C}, which
has the coordinates @math{(r,f,p)}, and its 8 adjacent places, as shown
in the following figure.

@center @image{mininim-figures/relative-coordinates-non-directed}

@smallindentedblock
@center @abbr{@strong{TL}, top left} @abbr{@strong{T}, top} @abbr{@strong{TR}, top right} @abbr{@strong{L}, left} @abbr{@strong{C}, center}
@center @abbr{@strong{R}, right} @abbr{@strong{BL}, bottom left}, @abbr{@strong{B}, bottom} @abbr{@strong{BR}, bottom right}
@end smallindentedblock

Then we define the following mapping between names and coordinates:

@multitable @columnfractions .50 .50
@headitem Name @tab Coordinates
@item TL @tab @math{(r,f - 1,p - 1)}
@item T  @tab @math{(r,f - 1,p)}
@item TR @tab @math{(r,f - 1,p + 1)}
@item L @tab @math{(r,f,p - 1)}
@item C @tab @math{(r,f,p)}
@item R @tab @math{(r,f,p + 1)}
@item BL @tab @math{(r,f + 1,p - 1)}
@item B @tab @math{(r,f + 1,p)}
@item BR @tab @math{(r,f + 1,p + 1)}
@end multitable


@node Foregrounds
@section Foregrounds
@cindex construction foreground
@cindex foreground, construction

Construction foregrounds have physical properties that determine how
they behave in certain events and also how the kid is affected by the
interaction with them.

@table @dfn

@cindex strictly traversable
@cindex traversable, strictly
@item Strictly traversable
This property means that the construction can't support the kid
vertically at its bottom, thus he falls immediately when trying to rest
on it.  Notice that cons having this property can't be @emph{hangable}.

@cindex traversable
@item Traversable
This property means that the construction can't @emph{indefinitely}
support the kid vertically at its bottom, thus he @emph{eventually}
falls when trying to rest on it.  Notice that @emph{strictly
traversable} is a particular case of this.

@cindex collidable
@item Collidable
This property means that the construction prevents the kid from passing
through it horizontally, thus he collides (often recoiling from the
impact) when trying to do so.

@cindex semi-collidable
@item Semi-collidable
This property means that the construction is @emph{collidable} only
under certain circumstances.

@cindex hangable
@item Hangable
This property means that the kid can hang on the construction's bottom,
in case there is an @emph{strictly traversable} one at its side.

@cindex depressible
@item Depressible
This property means that the construction is sensible to pressure at its
top, thus some reaction is triggered when the kid exerts such pressure.

@cindex trap
@item Trap
This property means that the construction might harm the kid.

@cindex rigid
@item Rigid
This property means that the construction can't be smashed by a falling
@code{LOOSE_FLOOR}, thus it stops at the con's top.

@cindex breakable
@item Breakable
This property means that the construction itself is broken by a falling
@code{LOOSE_FLOOR}, instead of being replaced by @code{BROKEN_FLOOR}.
Notice that all breakable cons are non-rigid and support a negative
integer extension.

@cindex dynamic
@item Dynamic
This property means that the construction has a set of distinct states
in which it can be in.  Such states matter for how the construction
looks and behaves.
@end table

It's possible that some of these properties may apply only under certain
conditions of the construction and/or the kid.

@node Floors
@subsection Floors
@cindex floors

@dfn{Floors} make the ground above constructions the kid stands on.  All
of them are @emph{hangable}, except for @code{NO_FLOOR}.

@multitable @columnfractions .19 .15 .15 .51
  @headitem Code @tab Dungeon @tab Palace @tab Notes

  @fgindex NO_FLOOR
  @item @code{NO_FLOOR}@footnote{The @dfn{no floor} con is called
  @dfn{empty} in the original game.}
  @tab
  @tab
  @tab This is an empty space.  This is @emph{strictly traversable} and
  uses no extension.

  @fgindex FLOOR
  @item @code{FLOOR}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-floor}
  @tab This is a normal floor. This uses the @emph{item} extension.

  @fgindex BROKEN_FLOOR
  @item @code{BROKEN_FLOOR}@footnote{The @dfn{broken floor} is called
  @emph{debris} in the original game.}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-broken-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-broken-floor}
  @tab As soon as a falling @code{LOOSE_FLOOR} encounters a @emph{rigid}
  construction, it disappears replacing the rigid con's top by a
  @code{BROKEN_FLOOR}.  In contrast, if it encounters a @emph{non-rigid}
  and @emph{non-traversable} construction, it disappears breaking that
  very con in case that's @emph{breakable} or otherwise replacing that
  by a @code{BROKEN_FLOOR}.  Finally, if it encounters a
  @emph{non-rigid} but @emph{traversable} construction, it pass through,
  breaking over the con in case that is not @emph{strictly traversable}.
  This uses no extension.

  @fgindex SKELETON_FLOOR
  @item @code{SKELETON_FLOOR}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-skeleton-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-skeleton-floor}

  @emph{loose board} in the original game.}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-loose-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-loose-floor}
  @tab This is rendered as @code{FLOOR}, but shakes as the kid hits the
  ground, by falling (from above), or vertically jumping (from below).
  If the kid hits near enough it's released and falls.  It might harm
  the kid when falling over him.  This is @emph{traversable},
  @emph{depressible}, a @emph{trap}, @emph{dynamic} and uses the
  @emph{can't fall} extension.

  @fgindex SPIKES_FLOOR
  @item @code{SPIKES_FLOOR}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-spikes-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-spikes-floor}
  @tab Spikes come out of it, killing the kid if he falls or steps too
  fast over it.  This is a @emph{trap}, @emph{dynamic} and uses the
  @emph{step} extension (ranging from 0 to 9).  This gets activated as
  soon as the kid is in the same room and place column, and in the same
  or higher floor without a wall in between.  Guards can activate this
  as well.

  @fgindex OPENER_FLOOR
  @item @code{OPENER_FLOOR}@footnote{The @dfn{opener floor} is called
  @emph{raise button} in the original game.}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-opener-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-opener-floor}
  @tab This may open one or more doors.  This is @emph{depressible},

  @emph{drop button} in the original game.}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-closer-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-closer-floor}
  @tab This may close one or more doors. This is @emph{depressible},
  @emph{dynamic}, @emph{breakable} and uses the @emph{event} extension.

  @fgindex STUCK_FLOOR
  @item @code{STUCK_FLOOR}@footnote{The @dfn{stuck floor} is called
  @emph {stuck button} in the original game.}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-stuck-floor}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-stuck-floor}
  @tab This is rendered like a pressed @code{CLOSER_FLOOR}, but it can't
  be unpressed.  This uses no extension.

  @fgindex HIDDEN_FLOOR
  @item @code{HIDDEN_FLOOR}@footnote{The original game doesn't have a
  @code{HIDDEN_FLOOR} construction by itself.}
  @tab
  @tab
  @tab This is rendered as @code{NO_FLOOR}, but as soon as the kid
  presses it, it's replaced by @code{FLOOR}.  This is
  @emph{depressible} and uses no extension.

@node Doors
@subsection Doors
@cindex doors

@dfn{Doors} are constructions that conditionally separate levels and
in-level sections.  Both door types are @emph{hangable}, @emph{dynamic}
and use the @emph{step} extension.  The extension determines the door
opening level, ranging from fully open (0) to fully closed.

@multitable @columnfractions .16 .20 .20 .44

  @fgindex DOOR

  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/d-door}
  @tab @center @image{mininim-figures/p-door}
  @tab This is @emph{semi-collidable} at right, as the kid might pass or
  not through it depending on the difference of the grid tip height and
  kid's movement height.  This is @emph{rigid} and its @emph{step}
  extension range from 0 to 47.

  @fgindex LEVEL_DOOR
  @item @code{LEVEL_DOOR}@footnote{The @dfn{level door} is called simply
  @emph{exit} in the original game.  There it's divided into two

  @emph{step} extension range from -44 to 43.
@end multitable

@node Chopper
@subsection Chopper
@cindex chopper

The @dfn{chopper}@footnote{The @dfn{chopper} is called @dfn{chomper} in
the original game.} can leave the kid in half.  It's a @emph{trap},
@emph{hangable at right}, @emph{rigid} and @emph{dynamic}.  It uses the
@emph{step} extension which range from 0 to 5 and 128 to 133 (bloody
counterpart).  With a @emph{step} of 0 or 128, it gets activated as soon
as the kid is in the same room and floor and there is no wall in
between.  It doesn't get activated by guards, but can kill them as well.
Other @emph{steps} make it permanently inactive.  The chopper nullifies
the @emph{hangable at left} property of its top construction.

@dfn{Carpets}@footnote{@dfn{Carpets} are called @emph{tapestry} in the

@code{DOOR} cons.  They come in two flavors: @code{CARPET} and
@code{TCARPET}; the watershed difference being the @emph{traversable}
property, which the latter has but the former lacks.  Both are
@emph{collidable} at right, @emph{rigid} and make use of the
@emph{design} extension.  The @code{CARPET} construction is also
@emph{hangable at left}.  Also, carpets nullify the @emph{hangable at

@chapter Movements
@cindex movements

In his journey to save the princess, the kid has to endure several
levels full of challenging traps and skilled opponents.  Run, walk,
turn, crouch, jump, hang, climb, take the sword, attack and defend are
some of the kid's movements at the user's disposal to make his way to
the princess tower.  Although, this is a relatively large set of
movements, basically all these are accomplished by some combination of
the directional and shift keys, often conditioned to the current kid's
state.  This chapter explains in detail all possible movements of the
kid.

@cindex movement mode
@cindex mode, movement
There are six modes of movement: @dfn{normal}, @dfn{crouch}, @dfn{run},
@dfn{hang}, @dfn{fall} and @dfn{fight}.  The mode the kid is in is the
foremost element determining how the input is translated into kid's
movements.

Notice that (whenever it makes sense) for any move, holding its
triggering keys continues or repeats the movement.@footnote{That's not
so for the original game, in which for many situations the user have to
release and press the keys again to have the movement repeated.}  Often,
when transitioning from a movement to another that share some keys, the
user can keep the common keys pressed, as well as any other keys ignored
by an intermediate movement, and the kid will just do the right thing.
It's also worth nothing that the kid responds to the input in real time,
that is, in the next animation cycle.@footnote{That's not so for the
original game, in which the kid delays one cycle to respond.}

@kindex LEFT
@kindex RIGHT
@kindex UP
@kindex DOWN
@kindex FRONT
@kindex BACK
@kbd{FRONT} and @kbd{BACK} are meta-keys used to refer to @kbd{LEFT} and
@kbd{RIGHT} conditionally subject to kid's facing direction.  The
@kbd{UP}, @kbd{DOWN}, @kbd{SHIFT} and @kbd{ENTER} keys are simply
referred as such.  The following figure illustrates how these keys
appear in a common keyboard.

The concept of @emph{directed relative positioning}, necessary to easily
describe the relations between constructions and the kid is analogous to
the already defined concept of @emph{non-directed relative positioning},
used to describe relations between constructions.  Consider the kid's
place @emph{C}, which has the coordinates @math{(r,f,p)}, its 8 adjacent
places and the direction the kid is facing, as shown in the following
two figures.

Quite a few movements might culminate in the kid hanging on a

happen, it's necessary to define the concept of @emph{hangable place}.

@cartouche
@noindent@strong{Hangable place:} we say the kid's place is
@dfn{hangable}, if (and only if) its top construction is @emph{strictly
traversable} and its top front one is @emph{hangable} in the opposite

Pressing @kbd{UP}, makes the kid perform a vertical jump.

In case his @emph{top construction} is @emph{strictly traversable} but
he isn't in a @emph{hangable place}, he performs a long vertical jump
and comes back to the @strong{exact} same position he was before the
jump.@footnote{This is not so in the original game, where he moves a
little bit forward at each vertical jump.}

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-vjump} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left}

In case his @emph{top construction} is not @emph{strictly traversable}

In case he's in a @emph{hangable place}, he performs a long vertical
jump (after coming close enough to the edge if he isn't already) and
hangs for a brief period of time.

When @emph{hanging free}, there is a limit for how much time the kid can
support his own weight, after which he drops from the construction.
Releasing @kbd{SHIFT} in the meantime has the same effect.  The kid will
fall either aligned with the @emph{hangable place's column} or with the
@emph{hangable place's front column}, depending upon which his feet are
in when he leaves the hanged construction.@footnote{It's not possible to
perform such movements in the original game, because there the kid
always falls over a @emph{non-strictly traversable} construction, in
case there is one.}

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-hang-free-fall}

The kid can sustain himself indefinitely when @emph{hanging non-free},
thus the only way to make him drop is by releasing @kbd{SHIFT}.  As one

column}.

@cindex mode, fall movement
@cindex movement mode, fall

This mode is not really related to a key combination, but instead to a
circumstance: the kid trying to support his own weight on an
@emph{strictly traversable} construction.  When this happens he
accelerates downwards (eventually reaching terminal velocity), until he
encounters a @emph{non-strictly traversable} construction or hangs at a
@emph{hangable place} which might appear in his way down.

If the kid hits a @emph{non-traversable} construction with sufficient
speed, he is harmed or can even die.  Falling from a height of one floor
inflicts no damage on him.  Two floors takes one life point.  Three or
more kills him instantly.

Holding @kbd{SHIFT} and @kbd{UP} puts the kid in counter attack and
counter defense mode.  At first, there is no immediate noticeable
difference from standing still in fight mode, but as an enemy
attacks@footnote{In the original game the terminology for ``attack'' is
``striking'', for ``counter attack'' is ``re-striking after block'', for
``defense'' is ``blocking strike'' and for ``counter defense'' is
``improper blocking''.}, the kid defends for certain. Then, depending
upon probability whose likelihood is given by the @acronym{KCA, Kid's
Counter Attack skill}, he may counter attack.

If he does, depending on the enemy's skills, they may counter defend and
then counter attack.  In that case, depending upon probability whose
likelihood is given by the @acronym{KCD, Kid's Counter Defense skill},
the kid may counter defend and the process restarts at the kid's counter
attack stage, making for a chain of counter attacks and counter defenses
whose length is determined only by the fighters' skills (and a little
bit of luck).  Every counter attack that is not responded with a counter
defense by the opponent, makes him lose a life point.

When standing still in this mode, releasing @kbd{UP} initiates an attack
(but at the same time makes the kid briefly vulnerable to the enemy's
attacks).  In this case the same counter attack and counter defense
chain logic described above is symmetrically applied.

Pressing @kbd{FRONT} and @kbd{BACK} (while holding @kbd{SHIFT} and
@kbd{UP}) makes the kid walk forward and backward, respectively, without
leaving this mode.  However, although walking backward doesn't make him
lower his guard, walking forward makes him vulnerable until he puts
himself on guard again.

The kid's skills are built up by defeating enemies.@footnote{In the
original game there is no such skills scheme.  There, if the user
doesn't get tired of pressing @kbd{SHIFT} and @kbd{UP}, the kid's
counter attack and counter defense are infallible.}  The more advanced
the defeated enemy's skills, the more the kid's skills improve.  Both
skills ---KCA and KCD--- are given by a number between 0 and 100,
interpreted as percentages, indicating the likelihood of counter
attacking and counter defending, respectively.

The engine has several key bindings that control an wide range of
settings and perform useful functions.  Many key bindings work anytime,
in the title screen, cut scenes and levels, while others work only in
the latter.  The key bindings are designed to mimic those of the
original game when started with the option @option{megahit}
(@option{improved} in latter revisions), however they can implement a
super-set of the functions available there and MININIM implements quite
a few more.  Also, many key bindings have a configuration option
counterpart.  @xref{Configuration}.

@chapter Configuration
@cindex configuration

@cindex command line options
@cindex environment variables
@cindex configuration files
MININIM can be easily setup to match user's preferences regarding the
way the game looks and behaves.  It features an integrated configuration
system which offers three distinct interfaces: @emph{command line
options}, @emph{environment variables} and @emph{configuration files}.

The configuration system uses the command line options parser as the
central interpreter for the configuration process.  Providing a single
options parsing routine allows for easy maintenance, equivalence between
methods and a canonical interface for integrating future methods.  For
this end, each configuration option backend implements a translator
between its specifics of option representation and access, to a normal
command line array.  Then the resulting options are roughly processed as
if they were given at the engine invocation command line.

As the options are the same for all three current methods of
configuration, and all of them are in essence processed as command line
options, it's unnecessary to describe all options for each separately.
Therefore, we provide a simple systematic rule for converting between
method option names and their command line equivalents, and then
describe only the latter.

@cindex option name conversion
@cindex conversion, option name
The rule for option naming conversion is very simple: for every command
line option of the form @option{x-y} there is an equivalent environment
variable option @env{MININIM_X_Y} and an equivalent configuration file
option @samp{x y}.

The multiple methods of configuration are cumulative but command line
options override any other, while environment variables override the
main configuration file.  In any method applicable later options
override earlier ones.  The option @option{--print-paths} shows, among
other things, the expected file name of the main configuration file.
Configuration files have INI format without any sections, like this:

@example
option 0 = value 0
...
option n = value n
@end example

Notice that many options can be changed on the fly by key binding
counterparts. @xref{Key bindings}.

The following remarks apply to the options list in this chapter:

@itemize
@item Long option names are case sensitive.

@item Option values are case insensitive.

@item Both can be partially specified as long as they are kept
unambiguous.

@item @var{boolean} is an integer equating to @samp{0}, or any sub-string
(including the null string) of @samp{FALSE}, @samp{OFF} or @samp{NO} to
disable the respective feature, and any other value (even no string at
all) to enable it.

@item For any non-specified option the documented default
applies.

@item Integers can be specified in any of the formats defined by the
C language.

@item Key bindings references are based on the default mapping.

@cindex legacy options
@cindex options, legacy
The legacy command line interface present in versions 1.0, 1.3 and 1.4
of the original game is supported for the sake of compatibility with
software that use it.  Legacy level and video non-option arguments are
honored, while all others are currently ignored silently.  The legacy
arguments can't be used by other configuration method besides the
command line.  The legacy command line arguments are:

These are case insensitive.  Additionally specifying a standalone
integer @var{i} is equivalent to passing the option
@option{--start-level=i}.  Unlike the original game, there is no
dependence between any two arguments (like start level and cheat
arguments).

Gamepad is an umbrella term used in MININIM to describe any hardware
device that enables the user to control the kid's movements.  Currently,
there is support for two classes of gamepads: @emph{keyboard} and
@emph{joystick}.

The primary joystick's axis and button numbers are listed by the option
@option{--joystick-info}.  The user can find out the number of a
particular axis or button by pressing it before invoking MININIM with
that option.  If a stick, axis or button given to an option doesn't
exist in the primary joystick, it's silently ignored.  The joystick can
be activated and auto-calibrated in-game by the @kbd{CTRL+J} key
binding.  @xref{Peripherals}.  If the joystick is peculiar enough,
proving the auto-calibration mechanism insufficient, the
@option{--joystick-axis-threshold} and
@option{--joystick-button-threshold} options may help.

@c --- Menu system;
@node Menu system
@chapter Menu system
@cindex menu system

MININIM features an uniform@footnote{As the menu system is uniform we
describe its general behavior and expected interface of interaction in
this chapter and let the chapters intended to describe major features
which make use of it, to focus on the specifics details of their subject
matter.} and non-intrusive bottom-line menu interface intended as a way
to provide quick and convenient access to engine features that would be
utterly complex or unfeasible to provide as simple key bindings, and
couldn't be offered by the configuration system because of their dynamic
on-the-fly characteristics.

When active the menu system makes use of the bottom line that is
traditionally used for transitory messages.  It looks like this:

@center @kbd{ABCDEF?}

Each capital letter indicates which key triggers the related @dfn{menu
command} (case insensitive).  Each menu command may be terminal or
non-terminal.  @dfn{Terminal menu commands} execute an action right away
when the user presses its correspondent key, while @dfn{non-terminal
menu commands} open a sub-menu with further menu commands to choose
from.  In principle, non-terminal menu commands may nest to arbitrary
depth.  A terminal menu command may be either an @dfn{input command} or
a @dfn{non-input command}.  The former puts the bottom line in input
mode, so the user can enter a value expected by the command, while the
latter needs no further information to perform its action.  There are a
few specialized input modes that are described in the following
sections.  Although capital letters usually represent the initials of
the related command, they have no universal or intrinsic meaning, and
are freely reused within sub-menus and may have been chosen arbitrarily
in case they were ambiguous.

The @kbd{?} key is present in every menu because it's special: it's used
to query the exact command performed by a given key.  When pressed the
bottom line says: @samp{PRESS KEY FOR HELP}.  Then, if any key expected
by the current menu is pressed, the description of the command performed
by it is given.  In case it's a non-terminal command, the description
ends with the @samp{>} character.  Otherwise, if it's an input command,
the description ends with the @samp{<} character.  Some commands may be
terminal or non-terminal, input or non-input, depending upon some
context like the mouse selection.  These have their descriptions ended
by the @samp{*} character.  The current menu comes back into view, in
case the user presses any key invalid for it.

Usually every menu command has a path prefix, indicating where in the
menu hierarchy it's located.  Consider the following menu system bottom
line:

@center @kbd{HYT>KJQTW?}

The @samp{HYT} string before the @samp{>} character is the @dfn{menu
path}.  It says the current menu is three levels deep, and its direct
parent is @samp{T}, whose parent in turn is @samp{Y}, whose parent in
turn is @samp{H}, which is located in the topmost menu.  By looking at
the menu path the user can figure out if he is actually where he's
supposed to, and how to quickly get there again from the topmost menu.
Sometimes a path prefix may contain digits indicating the index of the
object to which the menu commands apply, usually having a command to
change the selected index.  This is a provision to facilitate the
manipulation of a multitude of objects whose mechanism of selection
doesn't give ubiquitous visual feedback.

A similar notation is used for unequivocal and brief menu command
references in documentation.  Each top level menu is associated with a
capital letter --- the level editor menu is associated with @samp{E},
for instance.  If we want to describe the command to change the
foreground construction to @code{BIG_PILLAR_TOP}, for example, we take
its path prefix, @samp{CFPT} and prefix it with the top level menu
letter @samp{E}, like this: @samp{E>CFPT}.

There are two universal keys (called @dfn{menu return keys}) that allow
the user to go up into the menu hierarchy, from any type of command:
@kbd{BACKSPACE} and @kbd{/}.  The difference between both is that the
former ``confirms'' before returning, while the latter doesn't.  What
``to confirm'' means is dependent on the specific context and input mode
of the command at hand, but the general principle is that ``to confirm''
implies in a change of state.  In cases where no change of state is
involved, like a common non-terminal (sub-menu) command, both keys can
be used interchangeably.  Holding down any menu return key for a second
or so, gets the user back to the topmost menu.

While the menu system is active any key bindings that doesn't conflict
with its input methods continue to work as usual.  However, the menu
system takes precedence over the others, like the ones consisting of
alpha-numeric keys or any other keys with a special meaning, like
@kbd{?}, @kbd{BACKSPACE} and @kbd{/}.  In order for well established,
but conflicting key bindings to be easily accessed when working with the
menu system, the menu persistence comes in hand.  The menu system always
remembers the last command invoked, so the menu is restored to the same
state it was before being deactivated.  This allows for a fast
alternation between menu-based and key binding-based commands in tasks
that require both, like navigating through and editing a level.

The menu system never takes over the kid control keys, so the game can
be played while it's active.  On the other hand, it completely takes
over the transitory message bottom line, so even though a certain key
binding may take effect, any message that it usually shows on the bottom
line is suppressed.

@node Mouse selection
@section Mouse selection
@cindex mouse selection
@cindex selection, mouse

Often menu commands apply to a particular place within a level.  The
provided mechanism to select such a place is called @dfn{mouse
selection}.  While it's enabled the mouse cursor can be used to select a
particular place by simply pointing at the construction held by it.  The
selected place's construction will be shown in a brighter or darker
color than its surroundings (depending upon the video and environment
modes) like in the picture below.

@center @image{mininim-figures/mouse-selection}

As the user moves the cursor across the screen, the limits of each
selected place is determined by which construction it holds, roughly
considering the depth of the region the cursor points to.

It's easy to apply a place-targeting command to a whole contiguous
region of the current room by simply holding down the command key while
moving the mouse cursor through each one of its places.  For example, a
common application of this is to quickly populate a room with walls and
normal floors before changing smaller details when editing a level.

Mouse selection is also used by menu commands to give visual feedback on
the placement of a particular object within the game world.  Some
commands move the mouse selection arbitrarily and lock it on a
particular object, so the user doesn't interfere with their
selection-based report mechanism until them return.  In case these
commands need to report a nonexistent or invalid place (or object) they
lock the mouse cursor on the screen's very top left, meaning that the
mouse selection is pointing nowhere.  The mouse selection stores all
coordinates of a place within a level, meaning that commands may change
the currently displayed room as well, when moving or restoring the mouse
selection.

The mouse selection can't be used to select constructions of the rooms
above and below while at the current room, because the topmost pixels
are reserved to selection pointing nowhere and the bottom region to the
message line and menu system.

The mouse cursor changes to indicate conditions related to the the mouse
selection and the menu system.  Four different cursors are used for this
purpose, that (unless otherwise noted) have the following meanings:

@table @code
@item DEFAULT
no other situation applies
@item LINK
the current menu command expects or sets a valid mouse selection
@item QUESTION
the current menu command expects input
@item UNAVAILABLE
the mouse selection or some object selected using the menu system is
somehow invalid
@end table

While the mouse selection is enabled the horizontal and vertical mouse
wheels may be used to navigate through linked rooms.  Rolling the
horizontal wheel changes the currently displayed room to the room at
left or right, depending upon direction.  The vertical wheel works in a
similar fashion for the rooms above and below.  Holding @kbd{CTRL} while
rolling either of the wheels invert their meaning, that is, the
horizontal wheel becomes vertical and vice-versa.  This way, if the
user's mouse has only one wheel, he can simulate the missing one by
holding @kbd{CTRL}.  While the mouse selection is enabled, the third
mouse button (usually the one activated by pressing the vertical wheel)
sets the currently selected room to the one the kid is in.  It's also
possible to navigate through linked rooms by using key bindings.
@xref{Level navigation}.  However, this requires the menu system to be
disabled first.

The mouse selection honors the display flip mode and the mouse wheels
honor the gamepad flip mode.  @xref{Peripherals}.

@node Input modes
@section Input modes
@cindex input modes
@cindex modes, input

All input terminal commands use one of the input modes described in this
section in a way or another.  The input mode defines the type of
parameter expected by the command and the input interface for setting
it.  User input is processed in real time and the commands give visual
feedback usually in the form of changes in mouse selection and message
line status.  In this chapter the input modes are briefly described in
the next sections following the layout:

@enumerate
@item General output look of the particular input mode in the message
line.

@end table

This is the canonical input mode for setting integer parameters.  It
processes user input in such a way that it's impossible to enter an
integer outside the expected range.  The integer may be inputted
directly, useful in cases the user want to input a value significantly
far from the current one and doesn't care about any visual feedback for
values in between, or may otherwise be incremented or decremented one by
one.

If present, an auxiliary boolean parameter somehow associated with the
integer parameter may be set as well.  In some cases toggling it,
effectively changes the acceptable range for the integer parameter.

This input mode works similarly to a common non-terminal command, that
is, a sub-menu.  The difference is that what would otherwise be commands
are actually parameters which are toggled when the respective keys are
pressed.  Boolean inputs have two forms: @dfn{exclusive} and
@dfn{non-exclusive}.  In the former only one parameter may be enabled at
a time, so enabling a parameter automatically disables all others
(a.k.a. @dfn{radio buttons}).  The latter has no such restriction

This input mode is used to allow the user to walk through
uni-dimensional and bi-dimensional lists of elements while receiving
visual feedback, usually in the form of mouse selection and/or the
parameter index.  When handling bi-dimensional lists, for each element
in the first index there is possibly a list of elements in the second
index.  For uni-dimensional lists, either index may be used.





@c --- Level editor;
@node Level editor
@chapter Level editor
@cindex level editor

MININIM has a complete built-in level editor that enables the user to
easily construct and modify levels on-the-fly, using the menu system
interface (see @ref{Menu system}).  It gives the user quick and
convenient access to the full potential of the engine and its native
level format without quitting the playing mode, so the user can
simultaneously build and test the levels.  MININIM also features
unlimited undo/redo capability for modifications made to a level by
playing or editing.  @xref{Level editing key bindings}.

The level editor is enabled/disabled by clicking with the first mouse
button while the mouse cursor is within the game screen (be it visible
or not).  Alternatively, the user can use the @kbd{F8} key binding.  For
a more convenient play-editing experience, the last menu state is always
restored when enabling the level editor.  When enabled the mouse
selection is always active (see @ref{Mouse selection}), the kid can be
normally controlled and the game can be paused and unpaused freely.  The
topmost level editor menu looks like this:

@center @kbd{CERKGL}

Each one of these menu commands and their sub-commands (recursively),
are defined and explored in the following sections.


@node Construction E>C
@section Construction: E>C
@cindex level editor, construction
@cindex construction, level editor
@mcindex E>C

This non-terminal command has sub-commands for setting and querying the
three intrinsic construction components: @emph{foreground},
@emph{background} and @emph{extension}.  @xref{Constructions}.  All
commands in this hierarchy applies to the selected construction.  If the
mouse selection is pointing to nowhere when any command of this
hierarchy is invoked, it displays @samp{SELECT CONSTRUCTION} on the
message line and sets the mouse cursor to @code{UNAVAILABLE}.
Otherwise, the mouse cursor is set to @code{LINK}, unless an input
command is applicable, in which case it's set to @code{QUESTION}.

@center @kbd{C>FBEIARHCP}

@node Foreground E>CF
@subsection Foreground: E>CF
@cindex level editor, construction foreground
@cindex construction foreground, level editor
@mcindex E>CF

This non-terminal command has sub-commands for all possible construction
foregrounds.  Each immediate sub-command represents a construction
foreground class as described in @ref{Foregrounds}.

@center @kbd{CF>FPWDCMRA}

The only terminal sub-commands are @kbd{W} (Wall), @kbd{C} (Chopper) and
@kbd{M} (Mirror), because they represent classes with just one member.
The remaining non-terminal commands are comprised solely of non-input
commands, one for each member of the respective class.  Every non-input
command in this hierarchy works in the same way: they immediately change
the foreground of the selected construction.  The user may keep the
respective command key pressed while moving the mouse selection around
to easily apply a particular foreground to an wider region, as described
in @ref{Mouse selection}.  This command hierarchy is structured as

@node Event E>E
@section Event: E>E
@cindex level editor, event
@cindex event, level editor

Consider the figure below where @var{F} denotes an opener or closer
floor, @var{E} denotes an event and @var{D} denotes a door or level
door.

@center @image{mininim-figures/events}

Each opener and closer floor is actively associated with one (and only
one) event (by its extension) and each event is associated with one (and
only one) door or level door.  In the other way around, each door may be
passively associated with multiple events, and each event with multiple
floors.

When the kid presses an opener floor (closer floor resp.), the event
associated with it by its @emph{event extension} is triggered, then the
door associated with that event is opened (closed resp.), and the next
event may or may not be triggered depending upon the @emph{next} field
status of the triggered event.

This non-terminal command has terminal sub-commands for setting events
and navigating through the floor-event-door tree.

@center @kbd{E>DFRS}

The @dfn{selected event} is the event targeted by the sub-command
actions.  At return (for all sub-commands) @kbd{BACKSPACE} updates the
selected event, while @kbd{/} maintains its previous value.

@node Event@arrow{}Door E>ED
@subsection Event@arrow{}Door: E>ED
@cindex level editor, event@arrow{}door
@cindex event@arrow{}door, level editor
@mcindex E>ED

This command is used to find out which door is associated with a given
event.  It's an integer input whose parameter @var{i} is an event
number, and the auxiliary boolean @var{n} represents the @emph{next}
field status of the respective event (read-only).  @xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{ED>EVENT 0-255:i n}

It gives instant visual feedback locking the mouse selection on the door
associated with the selected event.  If the selected event isn't
associated with any door, the mouse selection points nowhere.
@kbd{BACKSPACE} keeps the mouse selection where it is, while @kbd{/}
restores it to the state it had before this command invocation.

@node Event@arrow{}Floor E>EF
@subsection Event@arrow{}Floor: E>EF
@cindex level editor, event@arrow{}floor

are the selected event number, and the second index run through the
associated floors.  @xref{List input}.

@center @kbd{EF>EVENT i -+<>}

It gives instant visual feedback locking the mouse selection on the
floors associated with the selected event.  If the selected event isn't
associated with any floors, the mouse selection points nowhere.
@kbd{BACKSPACE} keeps the mouse selection where it is, while @kbd{/}
restores it to the state it had before this command invocation.

@node Door@arrow{}Event E>ER
@subsection Door@arrow{}Event: E>ER
@cindex level editor, door@arrow{}event
@cindex door@arrow{}event, level editor
@mcindex E>ER

This command is used to find out which events are associated with the
selected door.  If the mouse selection is not over a door it displays
@samp{SELECT DOOR} on the message line and sets the mouse cursor to
@code{UNAVAILABLE}.  As soon as a door is selected this command turns
into a list input whose parameter @var{i} and second index run through
the associated events (the first index is disabled).  @xref{List input}.

@center @kbd{ER>EVENT i <>}

It displays the associated events on the message line as the user
increments/decrements the second index.  If the selected door isn't
associated with any events, @var{I} is replaced by the string
@samp{NONE}.

@node Set event E>ES
@subsection Set event: E>ES
@cindex level editor, set event
@cindex set event, level editor
@mcindex E>ES

This command is used to associate an event to a selected door.  If the
mouse selection is not over a door it displays @samp{SELECT DOOR} on the
message line and sets the mouse cursor to @code{UNAVAILABLE}.  As soon
as a door is selected this command turns into an integer input whose
parameter @var{i} is an event number, and the auxiliary boolean @var{n}
represents the @emph{next} field status of the respective event.
@xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{ES>EVENT 0-255:i n}

This command doesn't take effect immediately, so the user can freely
select a door and an event to associate with.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms
the association and returns, while @kbd{/} returns straight away.

@node Room E>R
@section Room: E>R
@cindex level editor, room
@cindex room, level editor

The layout of rooms disposition and adjacency in a level is given by
@dfn{room linking}.  For any given room there are four directions of
linking: @emph{left}, @emph{right}, @emph{above} and @emph{below}.

@cartouche
@noindent@strong{Room linking:} room A is @dfn{linked} to room B from
direction D, if (and only if) exiting room A from direction D enters
room B from the opposite direction.
@end cartouche

Notice that the only constraint put on links is that they must be well
defined, that is to say that every link points to one (and only one)
existing room.  Such wide definition allows for a number of
counter-intuitive room linking arrangements.  Some noteworthy examples
are:

@itemize
@item A room that links to iself.
@item A room that links to other room from more than one direction.
@item Two distinct rooms that link to the same room from the same
direction.
@item A room that links to another room from a certain direction, but is
not linked back from that room from the opposite direction.
@item An isolated room that can't be reached from other rooms.
@end itemize

MININIM officially supports all these room linking arrangement features
in the sense of providing robust physics and rendering behavior in such
circumstances.@footnote{The original game levels don't use such features
which are indiscriminately referred to as @dfn{broken links}.  Although
many custom legacy levels make use of them, it's safe to say that they
are not completely supported by the original engine, as some
arrangements like a room linked to itself from below could crash the
game.}  In a sense this is an intrinsic property of the engine, since by
convention room 0, which is usually linked to itself in all direction
and filled with walls, is used to delimit rooms that would otherwise
link recursively to other rooms @emph{ad infinitum} in order to
replicate the common euclidean room linking layout.@footnote{In the
original game there is no actual room 0, so links pointing to it were in
fact pointing to nowhere.  MININIM has an actual room 0, because of the
requirement of all links being defined.  That room is usually built in
such a way that linking to it has virtually the same effect of linking
to nowhere in the original game.  However that's not a strict
requirement, and room 0 can be treated as a common room by native
levels.}

In order to cope with some of the aforementioned link irregularities a
few linking policies may be enforced.  Keep in mind that they are not
applied when linking to room 0.

@cartouche
@noindent@strong{Reciprocal link:} a link from room A to room B from
direction D is @dfn{reciprocal}, if (and only if) there is a link from
room B to room A from the opposite direction.
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@noindent@strong{Locally unique link:} a link from room A to room B from
direction D is @dfn{locally unique}, if (and only if) there is no other
link from room A to room B from a different direction.
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@noindent@strong{Globally unique link:} a link from room A to room B
from direction D is @dfn{globally unique}, if (and only if) there is no
other room linking to room B from the same direction.
@end cartouche

This non-terminal command has sub-commands for handling room linking,
room constructions as a whole and navigating through rooms.

@center @kbd{R>JLSXARDHCP}

Room 0 links are never modified implicitly (not even by linking
policies), and can only be changed by explicitly using the room linking
command (see @ref{Room linking E>RL}).

There are complementary commands that can be used to navigate through
rooms by linkage and query the linking of the current room and its
surroundings.  @xref{Level navigation}.  As they are available as direct
alphabetic key bindings, the user should disable the level editor
temporarily before being able to invoke them.  That shouldn't be a
problem, though, as the menu system persistence allows for fast
alternation between these modes.  Alternatively, the user can navigate
through linked rooms while the mouse selection is active by using the
mouse wheels.  @xref{Mouse selection}.

@node Jump to room E>RJ
@subsection Jump to room: E>RJ
@cindex level editor, jump to room
@cindex jump to room, level editor
@mcindex E>RJ

This command instantly puts the mouse selection within the chosen room.
This is useful for reaching isolated rooms and room 0, that can't be
reached by linkage navigation.  It's an integer input whose parameter
@var{i} is a room number.  @xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{RJ>ROOM 0-24:i}

It gives instant visual feedback by changing the currently displayed
room to the chosen one.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} keeps the currently displayed
room, while @kbd{/} restores to the room displayed before this command
invocation.

@node Room linking E>RL

@center @kbd{RLd>ROOM 0-24:i}

It gives instant visual feedback by changing the currently displayed
room to the chosen one.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new linking to the
currently displayed room from direction @var{d}, while @kbd{/} maintains
the current link.  After return the mouse selection is restored.

The linkage is subject to the linking policies currently in effect.
@xref{Linking settings E>RS}.

@node Linking settings E>RS
@subsection Linking settings: E>RS
@cindex level editor, linking settings

@mcindex E>RS

This command is used to configure the current linking policies.  These
policies are used by room linking (see @ref{Room linking E>RL}) to
assist the user in circumventing some link irregularities (see @ref{Room

have the following meaning:

@table @kbd
@item R
reciprocal
@item L
locally unique
@item G
globally unique
@end table

The lower case letters represent the boolean value of their respective
parameters.

@center @kbd{RS>RrLlGc?}

@kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new linking policy settings, while @kbd{/}
maintains the current one.  When any of these parameters are turned on
all links are made in way to ensure the compliance with the policy
definition.

@node Exchange room E>RX
@subsection Exchange room: E>RX
@cindex level editor, exchange room
@cindex exchange room, level editor
@mcindex E>RX

This command exchange the links of the current room with those of the
chosen one from all respective directions.  It effectively swaps the
position of two rooms within a level.  Reciprocal links are swapped as
well, while non-reciprocal ones are left alone.  It's an integer input
whose parameter @var{i} is a room number.  @xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{RX>ROOM 0-24:i}

It gives instant visual feedback by changing the currently displayed

@cindex level editor, guard
@cindex guard, level editor

Enemies in the game are collectively referred to as ``guards''.  The
couple attributes that set guards aesthetically apart from one another
are: @dfn{type} and @dfn{style}.  The former is the most significant in
the sense that it determines the actual graphical shape of the
guard,@footnote{In the original game the guard type is not given per
guard, but instead per level: 3@arrow{}@code{SKELETON},
6@arrow{}@code{FAT_GUARD}, 12@arrow{}@code{SHADOW},
13@arrow{}@code{VIZIER}, others@arrow@code{GUARD}.} while the latter
determines only his coloring.  The five guard types are: @code{GUARD},
@code{FAT_GUARD}, @code{VIZIER}, @code{SKELETON} and @code{SHADOW}.
They have 8 different styles, given by integers ranging from 0 to
7.@footnote{The original game has the same styles (from 1 to 7) for
guards of type @code{GUARD}, but has a fixed style for all others.
MININIM has equivalent styles in that range for every other guard type,
and uses style 0 to give the original vizier style to guards of type
@code{GUARD} and @code{FAT_GUARD}, while reserving it as the original
style for all other guard types.} These are summarized in the table

@end multitable

Like the kid, each guard has a starting position and facing direction,
but naturally, every guard starts with a sword in his possession.  Each
guard also has an arbitrary number of total lives.@footnote{In the
original game the number of total lives is fixed per level and can't be
changed.}

Each guard also has its own set of skills which influence how strong
they are in battle.  There are six skills that are given as percentage
(between 0% and 100%, inclusive) indicating the probability of the
related action succeeding.@footnote{In the original game guard skills
can't be fine-tuned individually, as the game uses a predefined set of
12 possible skill configurations (ranging from 0 to 11).  @xref{Skill
E>GK}.}  In the following descriptions, @dfn{fight range} is the safe
distance from the kid guards strive to keep during battle: a step away
from striking, but far enough for not being hit.  @dfn{Attack range} is
the nearer distance guards have to be in order to make an effective
strike.

@table @dfn
@item Attack
Probability of the guard initiating an attack when in @emph{attack
range}.  If the kid is not in fight mode the attack is immediate
regardless of this.

@item Counter attack
Probability of the guard initiating a counter attack after a successful
defense.

@item Defense
Probability of the guard defending an attack when in @emph{attack
range}.

@item Counter defense
Probability of the guard defending a counter attack.

@item Advance
Probability of the guard going towards @emph{attack range} when in
@emph{fight range}, if the kid is not attacking.  If the kid is not in
fight mode the advance is immediate regardless of this.

@item Return@footnote{This skill attribute is not available in the original game as guards there never back off by themselves.}
Probability of the guard backing off to @emph{fight range} when in
@emph{attack range}.
@end table

For how these skills are related to kid's in battle, see @ref{Counter
attack and counter defense}.  For skills that are tested at each cycle
(12th of a second) like @emph{attack}, @emph{advance} and @emph{return},
1% means once every 8.33 seconds on average.  The user has to keep in
mind that this drops quickly (8% means once every 1.04 seconds), thus
care is needed or the guard might end up having very unnatural
movements, like alternating too fast between advancing and returning.

There are two more attributes that are categorized under guard skills,
which are not interpreted as percentage.

@table @dfn
@item Refraction period
How many cycles the guard is kept still after being hit, before being
able to advance and attack.

@item Extra lives
How many lives to add to the common total lives.
@end table

This non-terminal command has sub-commands for setting all these
characteristics.

@center @kbd{Gj>GPSJDKLTY}

All actions apply to the currently selected guard, whose index @var{j}
is shown by all commands of this hierarchy.  Before being able to
perform further actions upon a guard it has to be enabled.  This is done
by selecting the guard's type.  @xref{Type E>GT}.  If the currently
selected guard is disabled, the mouse cursor is set to
@code{UNAVAILABLE} and attempts to execute any other command will fail
showing @samp{DISABLED GUARD} on the message line.  While commands of
this hierarchy are active, darker semi-transparent images of the guards
are shown in their starting place, above all constructions and
characters.

@node Select guard E>GG
@subsection Select guard: E>GG
@cindex level editor, select guard
@cindex select guard, level editor
@mcindex E>GG

This command is used to change the currently selected guard.  It's an
integer input whose parameter @var{i} is the guard number.
@xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{GjG>GUARD 0-24:i}

It gives instant visual feedback locking the mouse selection on the
starting place of the chosen guard.  If the chosen guard is disabled,
the mouse selection points nowhere.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} makes the chosen
guard the currently selected one and keeps the mouse selection, while
@kbd{/} keeps the currently selected guard and reverts the mouse
selection to the state it had before this command invocation.

@node Place guard E>GP
@subsection Place guard: E>GP
@cindex level editor, place guard
@cindex place guard, level editor
@mcindex E>GP

This non-input command instantly puts the live instance of the currently
selected guard in the selected construction's place.  This is useful for
placing guards in arbitrary positions throughout the level for testing.
The guard is placed at rest independently of the movement he is
performing at the instant of invocation.  There is no restriction of
placement, and guards can be placed even inside walls.  If the mouse
selection is pointing to nowhere when this command is invoked, it
displays @samp{SELECT CONSTRUCTION} on the message line.  If the
currently selected guard has no correspondent live instance, it displays
@samp{NO LIVE INSTANCE} on the message line.

@node Set start position E>GS
@subsection Set start position: E>GS
@cindex level editor, guard start position
@cindex guard start position, level editor
@mcindex E>GS

This non-input command instantly sets the starting position of the
currently selected guard to the selected construction's place.  It gives
instant visual feedback.  There is no restriction of placement, and the
guard can be placed even inside walls.  If the mouse selection is
pointing to nowhere when this command is invoked, it displays
@samp{SELECT CONSTRUCTION} on the message line.

@node Jump to start position E>GJ
@subsection Jump to start position: E>GJ
@cindex level editor, jump to start position
@cindex jump to start position, level editor
@mcindex E>GJ

This non-input command instantly sets the mouse selection to the
starting position of the currently select guard.  This is a handy way of
finding him without having to re-select.  If the selected guard is
disabled or has no starting position yet, the mouse selection points
nowhere.

@node Toggle start direction E>GD
@subsection Toggle start direction: E>GD
@cindex level editor, toggle start direction
@cindex toggle start direction, level editor
@mcindex E>GD

This non-input command instantly toggles the facing direction of the
currently selected guard.  It gives instant visual feedback and only
works if the guard's starting position is located in the currently
displayed room.  In negative case, @samp{NOT IN THIS ROOM} is displayed
on the message line.

@node Skill E>GK
@subsection Skill: E>GK
@cindex level editor, guard skill
@cindex guard skill, level editor
@mcindex E>GK

This non-terminal command has integer input sub-commands for all guard
skill attributes.

@center @kbd{GjK>ABDEVRFXL}

For all of them, @kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new skill setting, while
@kbd{/} maintains the current one.  The first six commands correspond to
the probability-based skills.

@table @kbd
@mcindex E>GKA
@item A

@end table

Each one of these sub-commands is an integer input whose parameter
@var{i} is a percentage indicating the likelihood of the related action
@var{act} (relative to command @var{a}) succeeding.  @xref{Integer
input}.

@center @kbd{GjKa>act 0-100:i}

The next couple commands correspond to the remaining skill attributes
that are not probability-based.

@table @kbd
@mcindex E>GKF
@item F
Refraction period
@mcindex E>GKX
@item X
Extra lives
@end table

Each one of these sub-commands is an integer input whose parameter
@var{i} is the value of the related attribute @var{attr} (relative to
command @var{a}).

@center @kbd{GjKa>attr 0->:i}

The last command @kbd{K} (@samp{LEGACY TEMPLATES}) allows the user to
use a predefined skill template roughly equivalent to the ones available
in the original game.  There are 12 skill sets (ranging from 0 to 11) to
choose from.  These populate the values of each skill, which can be
later fine-tuned using the aforementioned commands.  It's an integer
input whose parameter @var{i} indicates the skill set of choice.  It
always starts at 0.

@center @kbd{GjKL>L.SKILL 0-11:i}

@node Lives E>GL
@subsection Lives: E>GL
@cindex level editor, guard lives
@cindex guard lives, level editor
@mcindex E>GL

This command is used to set the total lives of the currently selected
guard.  It's an integer input whose parameter @var{i} represents the
guard's amount of lives.  @xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{GjL>LIVES 0->:i}

@kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new total lives value, while @kbd{/}
maintains the current one.  If set to 0, the guard dies alone when the
level starts.

@node Type E>GT
@subsection Type: E>GT
@cindex level editor, guard type
@cindex guard type, level editor
@mcindex E>GT

This command is used to set the currently selected guard's type.  It's
an exclusive boolean input (see @ref{Boolean input}), whose parameters
have the following meaning:

@table @kbd
@item D
disabled
@item G
@code{GUARD}
@item F
@code{FAT_GUARD}
@item V
@code{VIZIER}
@item S
@code{SKELETON}
@item H
@code{SHADOW}
@end table

The lower case letters represent the boolean value of their respective
parameters.

@center @kbd{GjT>DdGgFfVvSsHh?}

It gives instant visual feedback, in case the starting place of the
currently selected guard is in the currently displayed room.  If any
parameter different from @kbd{D} is true, the guard is enabled.
@kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new type, while @kbd{/} maintains the
current one.

@node Style E>GY
@subsection Style: E>GY
@cindex level editor, guard style
@cindex guard style, level editor
@mcindex E>GY

This command is used to set the style of the currently selected guard.
It's an integer input whose parameter @var{i} represents the style.
@xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{GjY>STYLE 0-7:i}

It gives instant visual feedback, in case the starting place of the
currently selected guard is in the currently displayed room.
@kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new style, while @kbd{/} maintains the
current one.


@node Level E>L
@section Level: E>L
@cindex level editor, level
@cindex level, level editor

Each level has an actual number and a nominal number.  The actual number
is the one used to name its file.  The @dfn{nominal number} is the one
used for representative purposes like the @samp{LEVEL @var{n}} message
shown at the beginning of each level.  It's useful when a set of actual
levels should be considered as a single level in the broader sense.

Options related to the level as whole, like environment and hue modes,
or saving and loading levels are made available by this non-terminal
command.

@center @kbd{Lj>NEHSL}

The current level is indicated by @var{j} in all prefixed commands of
this hierarchy.

@node Nominal number E>LN
@subsection Nominal number: E>LN
@cindex level editor, level nominal number
@cindex level nominal number, level editor
@mcindex E>LN

This command is used to set the nominal number of the current level.
It's an integer input whose parameter @var{i} represents the level
nominal number.  @xref{Integer input}.

@center @kbd{LjN>N.NUMBER 0->:i}

@kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new nominal number, while @kbd{/} maintains
the current one.

@node Environment E>LE
@subsection Environment: E>LE
@cindex level editor, level environment
@cindex level environment, level editor
@mcindex E>LE

This command is used to set the level environment.  It's an exclusive
boolean input (see @ref{Boolean input}), whose parameters have the
following meaning:

@table @kbd
@item D
@code{DUNGEON}
@item P
@code{PALACE}
@end table

The lower case letters represent the boolean value of their respective
parameters.

@center @kbd{LjE>DdPp?}

Notice that the level environment isn't necessarily the currently
displayed one, because the user may have manually changed the latter
using a configuration option (see @ref{Rendering options}) or a key
binding (see @ref{Graphical rendering}).

This command gives instant visual feedback by changing the currently
displayed environment to the selected one.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the
new level environment and maintains the currently displayed one, while
@kbd{/} maintains the level current one and reverts to the previously
displayed environment.

@node Hue E>LH
@subsection Hue: E>LH
@cindex level editor, level hue
@cindex level hue, level editor
@mcindex E>LH

This command is used to set the level hue.  It's an exclusive boolean
input (see @ref{Boolean input}), whose parameters have the following
meaning:

@table @kbd
@item N
@code{NONE}
@item G
@code{GREEN}
@item R
@code{GRAY}
@item Y
@code{YELLOW}
@item B
@code{BLUE}
@end table

The lower case letters represent the boolean value of their respective
parameters.

@center @kbd{LjH>NnGgRrYyBb?}

Notice that the level hue isn't necessarily the currently displayed one,
because the user may have manually changed the latter using a
configuration option (see @ref{Rendering options}) or a key binding (see
@ref{Graphical rendering}).

This command gives instant visual feedback by changing the currently
displayed hue to the selected one.  @kbd{BACKSPACE} confirms the new
level hue and maintains the currently displayed one, while @kbd{/}
maintains the level current one and reverts to the previously displayed
hue.

@node Save E>LS
@subsection Save: E>LS
@cindex level editor, level save
@cindex level save, level editor
@mcindex E>LS

This non-input command saves the current level using the native level
format (see @ref{Native level format}) in the user data directory, where
they take precedence over levels in every other location.  The option
@option{--print-paths} show among other things where that directory is
located in the file system.  @xref{Path options}.  If this command
succeeds, the level cache is updated and @samp{LEVEL HAS BEEN SAVED} is
displayed on the message line.  Otherwise @samp{LEVEL SAVE FAILED} is
shown and an error message describing the problem is printed out to the
console.  The saved level can be fully reloaded using the @kbd{CTRL+A}
key binding (see @ref{Game flow}), or may have only its constructions
reloaded---keeping every other element (like characters) in their curent
state---using the reload command.  @xref{Reload E>LL}.

@node Reload E>LL
@subsection Reload: E>LL
@cindex level editor, level reload
@cindex level reload, level editor
@mcindex E>LL

This non-input command restores the current level's cached
constructions, which represent the level state at the moment of the
latest save operation.  This command is useful for undoing unintended
changes to the cons of a level when editing or playing it.  This command
always succeeds, showing @samp{LEVEL RELOADED} on the message line.

@node Native level format
@chapter Native level format
@cindex native level format
@cindex format, native level
@cindex level format, native

The @dfn{native level format} is the level format designed for MININIM.
In contrast, the level formats designed for the original game are known
collectively as @dfn{legacy level formats}.  @xref{Level options}.
Unlike these the native level format supports all features offered by
the engine, including:

@itemize
@item Arbitrary combinations of construction foregrounds and
 backgrounds.
@item Arbitrary number of guards per room.
@item Guard type selected per guard.
@item Guard style applicable to all guard types.
@item Total lives and skills @emph{fine-tuned} per guard.
@item Usable room 0.
@item Arbitrary room linking.
@item Hue selected per level.
@item Environment selected per level.
@end itemize

In this chapter the native level format is described in detail for
reference sake.  Programmers developing tools for interoperability with
MININIM may find this information useful.

The native levels are plain text INI-like files with no sections.  They
are named after their respective level numbers (padded with one zero in
case it is less than 10) and have the @samp{mim} extension.  Level files
generated by MININIM have the comment @samp{#MININIM LEVEL FILE} at the
top of each level file (this is not a requirement for validity, though).
After this, there is a long sequence of @code{@var{key}=@var{value}}
pairs up to the end of the file.  Each pair have its own line.  Unless
otherwise noted, @var{value} is a space separated sequence of integers
in the C language syntax.  The expected keys are described in the
sections below.

@node Nominal number N
@section Nominal number: N
